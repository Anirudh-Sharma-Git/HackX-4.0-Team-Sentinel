Realistic Orbital Simulation Ideas (Within Scope)

Instead of random feature additions, think like this:

1️⃣ Communication Window Simulation

Satellite sometimes becomes temporarily unreachable.

We already simulate OFFLINE.
But we can simulate:

Random temporary communication blackout

Delayed response

Low effort, high realism.

2️⃣ Automatic Rebalancing (Matches Optional Enhancement)

When satellite returns:

System auto-restores replication factor

You partially do this.
We can formalize it.

High value.

3️⃣ Simulated Latency

Add artificial delay when reading from a node.

So:

Primary takes 200ms

Replica takes 400ms

This demonstrates distributed retrieval.

Low-medium effort.
High demo value.

4️⃣ Storage Capacity Simulation

Each satellite has limited capacity.

If full:

Upload refused

Or rebalancing triggered

This matches real orbital constraints.

High wow.
Medium effort.

5️⃣ Caching Mechanism (Explicitly Mentioned in PS)

Add simple in-memory LRU cache for reconstructed files.

Show:

First download = slow

Second download = instant

This directly matches optional enhancement.

High wow.
Low-medium effort.
