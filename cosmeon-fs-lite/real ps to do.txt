Realistic Orbital Simulation Ideas (Within Scope)

Instead of random feature additions, think like this:

1️⃣ Communication Window Simulation

Satellite sometimes becomes temporarily unreachable.

We already simulate OFFLINE.
But we can simulate:

Random temporary communication blackout

Delayed response

Low effort, high realism.

2️⃣ Automatic Rebalancing (Matches Optional Enhancement)

When satellite returns:

System auto-restores replication factor

You partially do this.
We can formalize it.

High value.

3️⃣ Simulated Latency

Add artificial delay when reading from a node.

So:

Primary takes 200ms

Replica takes 400ms

This demonstrates distributed retrieval.

Low-medium effort.
High demo value.

4️⃣ Storage Capacity Simulation

Each satellite has limited capacity.

If full:

Upload refused

Or rebalancing triggered

This matches real orbital constraints.

High wow.
Medium effort.

5️⃣ Caching Mechanism (Explicitly Mentioned in PS)

Add simple in-memory LRU cache for reconstructed files.

Show:

First download = slow

Second download = instant

This directly matches optional enhancement.

High wow.
Low-medium effort.

🛰 A) Multi-Master Failover

You can say:

That would be implemented using leader election and distributed metadata replication.

💾 B) Dynamic Replication Factor

You can say:

We experimented with per-file RF but decided to keep fixed RF=2 for stability and cleanup correctness.

🌍 C) Network Latency Simulation

You can say:

We focused on durability and repair behavior. Latency simulation can be added via artificial delays in node reads.

📊 D) Monitoring & Observability

You can say:

UI already shows health state. Next upgrade would be real-time event logs and replica heatmaps.
